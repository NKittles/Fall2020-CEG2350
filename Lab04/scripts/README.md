Part 2
1. mkdir Lab04, mkdir scripts, touch marco.sh, touch polo.sh
2. my script for marco.sh looks likr this: 
pwd > ~/Fall2020-CEG2350/Lab04/scripts/output.txt

3. my script for polo.sh looks like this:
variable="$(<~/Fall2020-CEG2350/Lab04/scripts/output.txt)"
cd $variable

4. If i type $PATH I can see that /home/ubuntu/Fall2020-CEG2350/Lab04/scripts is in the paths
- running marco.sh and . polo.sh does work running in any directory
- my working export command inside of .bash_profile is: export PATH=$PATH:~/Fall2020-CEG2350/Lab04/scripts
